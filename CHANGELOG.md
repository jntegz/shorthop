# Changelog

What changed in each Shorthop release, and what to do when you upgrade.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-22

### Added

- Links and Misses: click a column header to sort by it, and click again to flip the order.
- Links and Misses: pages of 25, 50 or 100 rows. Your browser remembers the page size. On Links, the sort and page are in the URL, so you can bookmark them.

### Fixed

- Scanners no longer show up as human misses. A visitor who misses 5 or more different paths in one UTC day now counts as a bot, whatever its user agent says.
- More scanner paths are recognized as probes, such as `yarn.lock`, `*.js.map`, `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `server-status` and `swagger`.
- More hosting networks are treated as datacenters, such as M247, Leaseweb, Hostinger, IONOS, netcup and Censys.

### Upgrading

- Days already rolled up keep their old miss counts. To start clean, click **Clear all** on the Misses page once after you deploy. Today's misses, and every day after, use the new rule.
